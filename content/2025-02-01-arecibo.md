In 1974, a group of scientists broadcast a [message](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) towards Globular Cluster Messier 13 with the Arecibo telescope. The message was crafted in such a way that any aliens receiving it would potentially be able to understand some basic information about humanity.

### The components 

The [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_message) is great and goes into detail about how the components are meant to be interpreted, but I'll briefly summarize their purpose here (from top to bottom, with colors matching the image):  

<span style="background-color: #282828; color: white; ">1. The numbers one through ten</span>  
<span style="background-color: #CC79A7; color: white; ">2. Chemical elements in DNA</span>  
<span style="background-color: #009E73; color: white; ">3. DNA backbone with two base pairs</span>  
<span style="background-color: #282828; color: white; ">4. The estimated number of base pairs in the human genome</span>  
<span style="background-color: #0072B2; color: white; ">5. A picture of a double helix</span>  
<span style="background-color: #0072B2; color: white; ">6. (left) A ruler to indicate the human's height</span>  
<span style="background-color: #282828; color: white; ">7. (left) The number 14 (when multiplied by the wavelength of the message, it gives the height of the average human male) </span>  
<span style="background-color: #D55E00; color: white; ">8. (center) A picture of a human </span>  
<span style="background-color: #282828; color: white; ">9. (right) The estimated population of humans in 1974 </span>  
<span style="background-color: #F0E442; color: #282828; ">10. The major bodies of the solar system, with Earth raised </span>  
<span style="background-color: #CC79A7; color: white; ">11. A picture of the telescope </span>  
<span style="background-color: #0072B2; color: white; ">12. Unclear - maybe this indicates the ground?</span>  
<span style="background-color: #282828; color: white; ">13. The number 2,430 (when multiplied by the wavelength, it gives the diameter of the telescope)</span>  

### The problem 

The technology of the time made it impossible to accurately measure the number of base pairs in the human genome, and the value they used turns out to have overestimated it by over 37%. It was also coincidentally extremely close to the then-estimated population, which I can only imagine would send our alien interlocutors down a rabbit hole. The full human reference genome sequence was (perhaps surprisingly) only [finally determined](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y) in August 2023 (see [this nice overview](https://mk.bcgsc.ca/telomere-to-telomere-human-genome-assembly/) that covers how the reference genome has improved over the last few decades).

### Updating the Arecibo message

I wrote a [CLI tool](https://github.com/jimrybarski/modern-arecibo/) to generate the message with user-provided values for the genome size as well as the population, which has obviously changed. On the left, I've highlighted the components being updated (blue is the genome size, red is the population), and on the right, we see the message if it were being sent today, with 3,117,275,501 base pairs and 8,098,171,861 humans (the estimated population by the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/popclock/world) at the time of this writing):

### Buffer overflows and Pluto

The human population is represented by a binary number read from left to right, top to bottom, with the least-significant digit coming first. The largest value this could ever hold (see image on the left) without expanding into the depiction of the solar system would be 281,474,976,710,655 (unless we destroy every planet after Jupiter, which would give us an additional five rows of six bits, for a total of 302,231,454,903,657,293,676,543) - either way, we'll be able to continue using this format to alert aliens to our presence for many years to come. To accommodate the transition that occurred in 2006, the CLI tool also has a `--pluto-is-not-a-planet` flag that disables Pluto (right).
